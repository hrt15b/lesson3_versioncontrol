            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The term “Version Control” refers to systems used in programming which are used to track and record changes made to files, so that these changes may be recalled or reverted at a later date, which allows features from previous versions of a file or files to be examined, and also allows for the use of older files as a point of reference which may be used to correct errors made in a new version of a file or program. This topic is interesting, as it represents an important part of the programming process which could be used to avert potentially serious issues arising from lost files or programing errors. In the context of this course, Version Control is particularly useful as it allows for backups of previously file versions to be stored in the event that errors are made.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local Version Control systems are Version Control Systems in which files of different versions are simply copied and pasted into a different file directory than previous versions of these files. While local version control systems are simple and easy to use, they are often error-prone, as it is easy for a user to accidentally paste files into the wrong directory.  In order to address this issue, some programs have been designed to allow the creation of local version control systems that prevent these mistakes from occurring with the same frequency. This topic is interesting, as it discusses a form of version control system that is extremely common, despite being somewhat error-prone. In the context of this course, this topic is important as it represents one of the types of version control systems which could be used to store course-related files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control systems are Version Control systems in which files of different versions are placed in directories on a centralized Version Database hosted on a server. This system allows for multiple computers to connect to the Version Database, allowing for better cooperation between multiple individuals working on a project, and easier administration of the project. This topic is interesting, as it discusses a method of Version Control which is capable of correcting some of the flaws present in a Local Version Control system, although it does have flaws of its own, as if the server is lost or damaged, the files will be lost as well.  In the context of this course, this topic is important as it represents a method of version control which is more reliable than Local Version Control, and which could be used to store course-related files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed Version Control systems are Version Control system in which files of different versions are stored on both a database hosted on a server, as well as on several databases on client computers which are connected to the server. This allows for the files on the server or clients to be restored from the other systems should one of them fail, allowing for version files to be stored with little to no chance of file loss unless the server and all connected clients simultaneously fail. This topic is interesting as it covers a method by which files can be safely stored in a version control system with little chance of loss due to one of the connected systems failing. In the context of this course, this topic is important as the Version Control system being used in Lesson 3 is GitHub, which is a Distributed Version Control system.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Snapshots</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub differs from some other Version Control systems by storing files as a “snapshot” system, as opposed to simply recording the changes made to the files. In the “snapshot” system, a snapshot is made up of a record of the organization and content of files at a specific time, without making copies of files which have not been changed in order to maximize the efficiency of file storage. This system allows all previous versions of a file to be used without taking up excess storage space. This topic is interesting as it differs from the storage methods used by many other Version Control Systems. In the context of the course, this topic is important as GitHub makes use of a snapshot-based version control system.</p>
